# Summary

This treebank consists of dialectal transcriptions of spoken Komi-Zyrian. The texts are short segments from narratives from different areas where the language is spoken. The id's (to be corrected), will indicate the relations into spoken language documentation corpus built within Iźva Komi Documentation Project, funded by Kone Foundation in 2014-2016, and archived in [The Language Archive](https://tla.mpi.nl/). 

# Introduction

These materials of spoken Komi have been transcribed and translated by native speakers, and the orthographic transcription system, although matching when applicable Komi orthography, is primarily phonemic. They represent primarily the northern Iźva dialect of Komi, but to a certain extent also materials from other dialects have been, and will be, included.

# Acknowledgments

Thanks for LATTICE-CNRS laboratory and Kone Foundation for supporting the work.
